# Introduction

## What is site for?

This site is a resource, the purpose of which is to share interesting materials, my pratical tasks and ideas for projects and their implementation with other developers.

## About me

I'm Aleksandr Makarov - 3rd year student developer based in Finland. I mainly focus on backend development, but I also have experience in frontend development. Here is a set of technologies that I use to develop my projects:

- C# and ASP.NET Core
- Java and Spring
- React
- SQL and Databases

Since 2021 I have been studying backend application development and I still love it. I love developing projects from scratch and developing my skills in this field.

    Note right of John: Bob thinks a long<br/>long time, so long<br/>that the text does<br/>not fit on a row.

    Bob-->Alice: Checking with John...
    Alice->John: Yes... John, how are you?
