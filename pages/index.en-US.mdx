## About me

I'm Aleksandr Makarov - 3rd year student developer based in Finland. I mainly focus on backend development, but I also have experience in frontend development. Here is a set of technologies that I use to develop my projects:

- C# and ASP.NET Core
- Java and Spring
- React
- SQL and Databases

Since 2021 I have been studying backend application development and I still love it. I enjoy developing projects from scratch and developing my skills in this field.
